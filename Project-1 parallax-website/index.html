            <h2 class="secHeading ">Adventure Time !!</h2> <br><br>
            <p class="text ">There is a very famous quote by Hellen Keller, “Life is either a daring adventure or nothing.” An adventure is something challenging, that takes us out of our ordinary lives and forces us to try new things. The definition of adventure varies
                from person to person. It can best be described as, “The risky undertaking of an unknown outcome, the result of which may also be dangerous or in favour.”

                <br> <br> While the definition of adventure can vary from person to person, in broader context “risk taken when its outcome is unknown” can be termed as adventure. It is something that challenges you, it is something that lets you escape
                from your ordinary lives & thus it is something that changes you. It can make you feel more live & refreshed. Adventures can be sought in numerous ways such as mountaineering, river rafting, trekking, skydiving, scuba diving, etc. Even
                exploring new people & cities can be considered as an adventure.

            </div>
            <p class="text ">Time management is a very important thing to me, and is also important in general. I always find myself struggling to make the best of my time. If I have nothing to do I often sit and do nothing at all. Learning to manage my time wisely can
                help me improve my life by helping me spend time on important things, making time to do fun things, and to never wasting the time that I have.

                    <h2 class="desc ">PARA GLIDING</h2>

                </div>
                <p class="text ">Paragliding, sport of flying parachutes with design modifications that enhance their gliding capabilities. Unlike hang gliders, their close relations, paragliders have no rigid framework; the parachute canopy acts as a wing and is constructed
                    of fabric cells with openings at the front that allow them to be inflated by movement through the air—the “ram-air” effect.

                    <br> <br> There are several training programs in skydiving. In the original military training, known as a static-line program, a skydiver exits the aircraft and wears a chute that is deployed by a tether line. With the United States
                    Parachute Association’s Accelerated Freefall program, two “jumpmasters” dive with the student—at altitudes usually 10,000 feet or more above ground level—and assist the student in remaining stable while performing a series of tasks
                    designed to train the student to maintain stability in freefall and appropriately deploy the parachute.

                    <h2 class="desc ">SURFING</h2>

                </div>
                <p class="text ">Surfing’s roots lie in premodern Hawaii and Polynesia, where the sport was practiced by both men and women from all social strata from royalty to commoners. Early European explorers and travelers praised the skills of Hawaiian surfers,
                    but 19th-century missionaries assigned to the islands disapproved of the “constant intermingling, without any restraint, of persons of both sexes” and banned the pastime. Surfing was practiced only sporadically in Hawaii by the end
                    of the 19th century.

                    <br> <br> Organized competitions helped to counter this negative image and to win surfing some social respectability. In 1953 the Waikiki Surf Club hosted the first international surfing championships for men and women at Makaha, Hawaii.
                    This competition marked the official birth of the sport of surfing, with judges awarding points for length of ride, number of waves caught, skill, sportsmanship, and grace on the board. In 1964 the recently formed Australian Surfriders
                    Association hosted the first world surfing championships at Sydney.
